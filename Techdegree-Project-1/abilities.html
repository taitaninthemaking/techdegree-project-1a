               <h2>Abilities</h2>
               <p>I already explained the way my abilities work and that they are split up into 2 facets</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Emitter abilities</li>
        <li>Transformation abilities</li>
        </ul>            
        
               <p> If you have enjoyed reading my concept so far, here is a couple more </p>
               
               <h2>Detect</h2>
               <p><img class="transformation-img" src="images/detect.png" alt="detect-img">
                <p>We all come from various walks of life which is why at any given point in time a persons state of mind can change drastically. The detect ability enables me to read the chemical energy someone else is giving off and determine its state in relation to their mood. For example; happy frustrated, excited, sad, confused, calm  </p>

             <section class="card">
               <h2>Absorb Pain</h2>
               <p><img class="transformation-img" src="images/empathy.png" alt="empath-img">
               <p>By gathering the energy within myself and my surrounding i imbue: peace, mutual understanding, optimistic love and positive tension to my target. This purges uncertainty and nervous temperament to pave the way for trust and empathy between the target and the user </p>
         
               <h2>Force Field</h2>
               <p><img class="emitter-img" src="images/plant-cells.png" alt="force-field-img">
                 <p>The transformation ability enables me to generate an external membrane like a plant cell wall from my cells that comes out and surrounds me over an adjustable area span. Within this membrane a fragrance is released and all that come into contact with it becomes fear and doubt free and are transformed into determined, driven and energetic beings of productivity</p>
