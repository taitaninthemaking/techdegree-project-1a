        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>A wise man once said to me that with great power comes great responsibilities and that I should always stand-up for the little guy because that’s what it means to be a man.</p>
        <p>Growing up was hard for me because I was different from the other kids. There was a deep seated longing to understand how we really feel inside and the way words appear to the mind and ear as a single layer of an onion bulb.</p>
